            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <h3>
                My name is Michelle Yang. 
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am a recent graduate of a software engineering bootcamp. I am on the hunt for a software engineering position in a company that will allow me to showcase my skills and grow with the company.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of being a programmer, I am your typical midwestern girl from Minnesota. I was raised in Minnesota but have decided to plant my roots in San Diego, so you will definitely see or hear of me traveling back and forth. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a huge family-oriented person. As my dad puts it, "If Michelle is home, that is when family and all of the kids will finally gather." I pride myself on being the self-proclaimed favorite auntie of 7 children.
            </p>
